EGNOS automated uploading and installing tool developped in JAVA
I reused different classes implemented in the EGNOS audit tool.

Tool designed and implemented during Thales Alenia Space internship 2017 with IDE NetBeans. Libraries used are located in lib/

Beware, this tool only works on NLESG2 assets.

This tool's main purpose is to install new files on EGNOS NLESG2 assets: 
- Identify and manage the mode of the asset
- Upload the files to install in FTP to the asset
- Install the files
- Run with the new files

A GUI was also design in order to make the use of this tool easier.
